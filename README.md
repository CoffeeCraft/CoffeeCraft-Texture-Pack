# CoffeeCraft-Texture-Pack
The textures used by the CoffeeCraft members

This is mostly a collection of textures from Vanilla Tweaks, and this shortcut will get you the bulk of them: <https://vanillatweaks.net/share#B0sr4Q>

I've also added the textures for the rotation wrenches, custom paintings, and a couple other small changes - including:

* Custom Totem and Paintings (built with boredom ðŸ™ƒ)
* Tame Wolf -> Black Lab from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/black-lab-4559911/>
* Custom Villager Voices from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/custom-villager-sounds/>
* Custom Wandering Trader Voices from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/custom-wandering-trader-voices/>
* Shield Corrections from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/shield-corrections/>
* Restock Clock from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/restock-clock/>
* Terracotta True from <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/re-4074934/>
